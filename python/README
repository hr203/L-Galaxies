Python scripts to read L-Galaxies data files and example routines to
"pickle/unpickle" desired galaxy properties.

These scripts should be run in ipython using "run -i" so that they
have access to the top-level name-space (i.e. they can share data).
Alternatively write another script that calls these scripts (e.g. if
writing a script to draw a figure).

Note that the scripts refer to a template struct definition for the
data.  If this does not exist, then it can be generated by running
"make metadata" in the L-Galaxies directory -- this should be done at
the same time that the data is generated, and the two shoudl be stored
together.

script_read.py
--------------

Example script to read in selected galaxy properties in snap format

script_pickle.py
--------------

Example script to pickle the galaxy data (i.e. dump to disk)

script_unpickle.py
--------------

Example script to read back pickled data from disk

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

read_lgal.py
------------

Contains the functions that read the binary data files.  The user
should not have to change these:
       * read_tree_input - The input tree files that L-Galaxies uses.
       * read_tree - Galaxy data in tree format
       * read_snap - Galaxy data in snapshot format
